Welcome to BioSim's documentation!
==================================

The BioSimulation is a small Python package.
It is able to create an island and place herbivores and carnivores on it.
During the simulation the Python package vizualises its results.

* To vizualise BioSimulations results :func:`matplotlib.pyplot.imshow` has been used.
* :func:`matplotlib.pyplot.subplot` is used to create 5 figures at once
* The :class:`simulation` gives the user the ability to interact with the parameters to control the island.
